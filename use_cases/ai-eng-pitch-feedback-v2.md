I see your point - the MCP implementation we were looking at was indeed focused on documentation retrieval via llms.txt files. You're right that a similar approach could be used for pitch deck creation, leveraging the Model Context Protocol to enhance the solution. Let me refocus on how we could use MCP servers and the Python SDK specifically for the pitch deck generator.

## MCP Integration for Pitch Deck Generation

The Model Context Protocol could significantly enhance the pitch deck generator by providing specialized tools and contextual information through a standardized interface. Here's how we could implement this:

### 1. Custom MCP Servers for Pitch Decks

Using the [modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) as a foundation, we could create specialized MCP servers for pitch deck generation:

```python
# Example of a custom pitch deck MCP server
from modelcontextprotocol.servers import MCPServer
from modelcontextprotocol.servers.tools import Tool

class PitchDeckServer(MCPServer):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("pitch-deck-tools")
        
        # Register specialized tools
        self.register_tool(
            Tool(
                name="fetch_market_data",
                description="Fetches relevant market data for the pitch deck",
                function=self.fetch_market_data
            )
        )
        
        self.register_tool(
            Tool(
                name="generate_slide_visuals",
                description="Suggests appropriate visuals for pitch slides",
                function=self.generate_slide_visuals
            )
        )
        
        self.register_tool(
            Tool(
                name="format_for_discord",
                description="Formats pitch content for Discord sharing",
                function=self.format_for_discord
            )
        )
    
    async def fetch_market_data(self, query, slide_type):
        # Implementation that fetches relevant market data
        pass
        
    async def generate_slide_visuals(self, slide_content, slide_type):
        # Implementation that generates visual suggestions
        pass
        
    async def format_for_discord(self, pitch_content):
        # Implementation that formats content for Discord
        pass
```

### 2. Integrating the Python SDK

Using the [modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk), we could integrate these MCP tools into our graph-based workflow:

```python
from modelcontextprotocol.client import MCPClient
from modelcontextprotocol.schema import ExecuteToolParams

async def enhance_slide_with_mcp(state: PitchState, config: RunnableConfig):
    """Use MCP tools to enhance a slide with market data and visual suggestions"""
    
    # Get the slide that needs enhancement
    slide = state["current_slide"]
    
    # Initialize MCP client
    mcp_client = MCPClient(
        server_url="http://localhost:8000",  # URL to your custom pitch deck MCP server
        client_name="pitch-deck-generator"
    )
    
    # Fetch market data if applicable
    if "Market" in slide.name or "Impact" in slide.name:
        market_data_params = ExecuteToolParams(
            name="fetch_market_data",
            arguments={
                "query": slide.description,
                "slide_type": slide.name
            }
        )
        market_data_result = await mcp_client.execute_tool(market_data_params)
        slide.context = market_data_result.content
    
    # Generate visual suggestions
    visual_params = ExecuteToolParams(
        name="generate_slide_visuals",
        arguments={
            "slide_content": slide.content,
            "slide_type": slide.name
        }
    )
    visual_result = await mcp_client.execute_tool(visual_params)
    slide.visual_suggestion = visual_result.content
    
    return {"current_slide": slide}
```

### 3. MCP for Specialized Pitch Resources

We could also use the MCP approach to provide contextual resources about pitch best practices. Instead of just documentation, we could create specialized resources for different types of pitches:

```python
# Configure MCP for pitch resources
pitch_resources_config = {
    "mcpServers": {
        "pitchResources": {
            "command": "uvx --from mcpdoc mcpdoc --urls \"InvestorPitches:https://pitchresources.com/investor/llms.txt\" \"DemoDayPitches:https://pitchresources.com/demoday/llms.txt\" \"ExecutivePitches:https://pitchresources.com/executive/llms.txt\" --host localhost --port 3300"
        }
    }
}
```

This would allow the LLM to access specialized guidance for different pitch scenarios, which could be incorporated into the slide generation process.

## Integration with Graph-Based Workflow

To integrate this MCP approach with the graph-based workflow we've already established as ideal for your use case:

1. **Add MCP-Enhanced Nodes**:
   - Create new nodes in the workflow that leverage MCP tools
   - Use these tools to enhance slides after initial generation

2. **Enhance the Feedback Loop**:
   - Use MCP to provide specialized feedback based on pitch type
   - Create role-specific feedback mechanisms (investor perspective, executive perspective, etc.)

3. **Extend Research Capabilities**:
   - Leverage MCP for more targeted market research
   - Access specialized databases for industry-specific information

Here's an example of how the graph structure might be extended:

```python
# Extend the graph with MCP-enhanced nodes
builder.add_node("enhance_slides_with_mcp", enhance_slides_with_mcp)
builder.add_node("generate_role_specific_feedback", generate_role_specific_feedback)

# Add new edges
builder.add_edge("build_slide_with_web_research", "enhance_slides_with_mcp")
builder.add_edge("enhance_slides_with_mcp", "suggest_visuals")
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Specialized Tools**: MCP provides a clean interface for adding specialized pitch deck tools

2. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new capabilities as your bootcamp evolves

3. **Structured Data Exchange**: Standardized way to exchange pitch-related data

4. **Role-Based Feedback**: Tools can simulate different stakeholder perspectives

5. **Resource Access**: Contextual access to pitch best practices and examples
