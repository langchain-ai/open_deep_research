I see you're developing a plan to adapt the Open Deep Research framework for the pitch deck generator scenario. Based on your notes in the AI engineering pitch markdown file and your reference to Model Context Protocol (MCP), I can help outline the key changes and integrations needed.

## MCP Integration for Pitch Deck Generation

The Model Context Protocol would be highly valuable for this pitch deck generator, especially when integrated with the graph-based workflow approach we've determined is best for your use case. Here's how MCP tools could enhance your implementation:

### 1. Documentation Access via MCP

Based on your `tools_mcp_llms.md` file, integrating MCP would allow the pitch deck generator to:

- Access structured documentation about pitch best practices
- Retrieve examples of successful pitch decks in specific domains
- Pull in relevant market data through specialized tools

For example, you could set up an llms.txt file specifically for pitch deck formats and investor expectations:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pitchDeckResources": {
      "command": "uvx --from mcpdoc mcpdoc --urls \"PitchFormats:https://yourdomain.com/pitch-formats/llms.txt\" \"InvestorExpectations:https://yourdomain.com/investor-insights/llms.txt\" --host localhost --port 3200"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Visual Suggestion Tools

Your proposed changes to the workflow include a `suggest_visuals` node. This could be enhanced with an MCP integration that:

- Provides access to chart and graph generation tools
- Suggests mockup templates based on the slide content
- Offers image search for relevant visuals

### 3. Research Enhancement with MCP

The graph-based approach already has strong research capabilities, but MCP could extend this with:

- Market data retrieval tools that connect to industry databases
- Competitive analysis tools that pull structured information about similar products
- Academic citation tools for adding credibility to market claims

## Implementation Strategy

Based on your notes in `ai_engineering_pitch.md` and the MCP documentation, here's a refined approach:

1. **Adapt the State Definition**:
   - Create `PitchState` as you've outlined 
   - Include fields for slides, tagline, and visuals

2. **Enhance the Graph Workflow**:
   - Implement your proposed nodes (`generate_pitch_plan`, `generate_tagline`, etc.)
   - Add MCP integration nodes for visual suggestions and market research

3. **Update Prompts**:
   - Use your pitch-focused prompts from `ai_engineering_pitch.md`
   - Add additional MCP-aware prompts that can utilize external tools

4. **MCP Configuration**:
   - Set up specific MCPs for pitch deck resources
   - Configure domain access controls as outlined in your MCP documentation

## Key MCPs That Would Be Helpful

Based on your needs, these specific MCP tools would be particularly valuable:

1. **Market Data MCP**: Connect to business databases to pull market size, growth rates, and competitor information for the "Market" slide

2. **Visual Generator MCP**: Generate chart suggestions, mockups, and visual aids based on slide content

3. **Pitch Format MCP**: Access templates and best practices for different pitch scenarios (investor, demo day, executive)

4. **User Research MCP**: Pull in user pain points and journey information to strengthen the problem statement

5. **Discord Integration MCP**: Format pitch content for Discord posts, including appropriate tagging and formatting

## Next Steps

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this integration? I can help with:

1. Detailed code changes to implement the MCP integration in your graph-based workflow
2. Expanded prompt templates that leverage MCP tools
3. Configuration examples for specific MCP servers relevant to pitch decks
4. A step-by-step implementation plan prioritizing the most impactful features first
