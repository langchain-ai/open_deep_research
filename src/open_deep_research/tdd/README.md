# Technical Due Diligence (TDD) Agent System

This module extends the Open Deep Research project to create a specialized multi-agent system for technical due diligence in mergers and acquisitions.

## Overview

The TDD Agent System is designed to automate and enhance the technical due diligence process by leveraging a multi-agent architecture. It consists of specialized agents for different domains of technical due diligence, a planning agent to coordinate the process, and a writer agent to synthesize findings into a comprehensive report.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for each domain of technical due diligence
- **Virtual Data Room (VDR)**: Central repository for all reports, findings, and evidence
- **Comprehensive Assessment**: Covers technology stack, architecture, SDLC, infrastructure, security, IP, and teams
- **Interdependency Analysis**: Identifies connections between findings from different domains
- **Gap Identification**: Highlights information gaps that require further investigation
- **Standardized Reporting**: Consistent format for findings and reports across all domains
- **Quantitative Impact Assessment**: Evaluates risk level, timeline impact, and cost impact for each finding

## Module Structure

- `state.py`: Defines the state classes used by the TDD agents
- `configuration.py`: Configuration classes for customizing the TDD system
- `vdr.py`: Virtual Data Room for storing and managing reports and findings
- `tools.py`: Tools used by the TDD agents for assessments and reporting
- `agents.py`: Specialized agents for each domain of technical due diligence
- `main.py`: Main entry point for running the TDD process

## Agent Types

1. **Planning Agent**: Coordinates the overall TDD process
2. **Domain-Specific Agents**:
   - Tech Stack Agent: Assesses programming languages, frameworks, libraries, etc.
   - Architecture Agent: Evaluates software architecture and design
   - SDLC Agent: Assesses software development lifecycle processes
   - Infrastructure Agent: Evaluates hardware, networking, and cloud infrastructure
   - Security Agent: Assesses cybersecurity practices and vulnerabilities
   - IP Agent: Evaluates intellectual property assets and risks
   - Teams Agent: Assesses technical teams and processes
3. **Writer Agent**: Synthesizes findings into a cohesive final report

## Usage

### Command Line

```bash
python -m open_deep_research.tdd.main --query "Perform technical due diligence on Company X" --output "company_x_tdd_report.json"
```

### Optional Arguments

- `--config`: Path to configuration file
- `--domains`: Domains to include in the assessment
- `--deal-type`: Type of deal (acquisition, merger, investment, partnership)
- `--assessment-depth`: Depth of assessment (light, standard, deep)
- `--risk-framework`: Risk assessment framework
- `--log-level`: Logging level

### API Usage

```python
from open_deep_research.tdd.configuration import TDDConfiguration
from open_deep_research.tdd.run import run_tdd

# Create configuration
config = TDDConfiguration(
    deal_type="acquisition",
    assessment_depth="standard",
    risk_assessment_framework="OWASP",
    domains=["tech_stack", "architecture", "security"]
)

# Run TDD process
result = await run_tdd("Perform technical due diligence on Company X", config)

# Access results
final_report = result["final_report"]
domain_reports = result["domain_reports"]
interdependencies = result["interdependencies"]
gaps = result["gaps"]
```

## Customization

The TDD Agent System can be customized by modifying the configuration:

- **Models**: Change the models used by each agent
- **Domains**: Include or exclude specific domains
- **Assessment Depth**: Adjust the depth of the assessment
- **Risk Framework**: Use a different risk assessment framework

## Integration with Open Deep Research

The TDD Agent System is built on top of the Open Deep Research project and leverages its core components:

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Extends the existing multi-agent architecture
- **Search Tools**: Uses the same search tools for gathering information
- **Configuration System**: Extends the configuration system
- **Logging**: Uses the centralized logging system
